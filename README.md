# MediaMe
Using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node), we created an app where users can track their favorite television shows.  Simply enter the shows you want to track in our search bar.  You can then view information on that particular TV show, including number of seasons and episodes, and whether the show is running or ended.  Users can track what seasons and episodes have already been viewed.  Stay tuned for a future calendar function that will inform users of upcoming episodes.
